# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at [**ALX School**](https://www.alxafrica.com/). It aims to learn about how to handle standard input and output and how to combine commands and filters with redirections in [**Shell**](https://www.shellscript.sh/).

## Technologies

-   Scripts written in [`Bash 5.1`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
-   Tested on [`Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
